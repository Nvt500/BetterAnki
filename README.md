# BetterAnki
I try to make anki with html so it is better. It kinda is, kinda isn't.

The json file just holds all the information to give out and is made by taking a .apkg file and parsing some of its files.

The .apkg file for this project is from Core 2k_6k Optimized Japanese Vocabulary anki set where I just clicked download. It may not work with every set but probably some of them.
